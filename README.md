# Unit5Mid

There were parts that were fairly straight forward such as the fragment creations but unfortunately I wasn't able to get done due to issues with 
creating POJO's. Unfortunately i kept getting network erros of expecting strings but getting arrays. Creating the recycler view was also
fairly simple but wasn't able to showcase any of the data pulled due to the network errors. 


Understood:
RecyclerViews
Retrofit
Fragments

Need to Practice:
Creating different kinds of POJO's
Allocating enough time to network calls versus fragment creations
